###Data Cleaning With Excel - Conditional Formatting  

**Description:** This self-paced Excel project focuses on using conditional formatting to visually identify patterns, trends, and outliers within a dataset. Key techniques include applying icon sets to show directional changes (increases, decreases, steady values), using color scales to highlight values from lowest to highest through gradient shading, and data bars to represent values proportionally within cells. The project also covers Top/Bottom Rules for quickly spotting top performers or underperformers, and cell highlighting tools to flag values based on logical conditions like "greater than," "equal to," or "duplicates." Additionally, it demonstrates how to use custom formulas to apply formatting rules, making it a powerful approach for dynamic data analysis and data cleaning.  
**Skills:**  Applied XLOOKUP function to retrieve specific values from data set.  
**Technology:** Excel.
